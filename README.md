A very basic ORM for python.

Currently only allows for some basic comparision operators, and the AND operator on the WHERE clause.

Available Operators
===================

    - =
    - !=
    - >
    - >=
    - <
    - <=
    - AND


TODOS:
======

    - Support for OR operator
    - Support for other clauses
    - Add a setup.py
    - Add tests
    - Add support for querying the database instead of just spitting out the query
